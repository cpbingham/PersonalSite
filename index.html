                Welcome to my personal website! This site is meant to serve as a
                central hub for information about myself, my work and anything
                else I decide to be worth sharing. My intention is for my site
                to be able to grow and adapt over time with me in order to best
                fit my needs.

        <!--About Me-->
        <section class="about" id="about">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Colin, a software developer currently based in Toronto,
                CA who is interested in building things for the modern internet.
                I'm passionate about working on products that are capable of making a
                positive, real world impact. My goal is to help promote and contribute
                to the use and development of software that will help keep the
                internet safe, free and open to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated from Queen's University in 2018, where I obtained a
                degree in Computer Science, specializing in Software Design. After
                spending the summer travelling, I joined Tata Consultancy Services
                in September, where I have been working as a software developer since.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time I most enjoy exercise, being in the outdoors,
                cooking, playing/listening to music and learning new things.
            </p>

                            For our degrees capstone project, my team of 3 and I
                            were contracted by Kingston General Hospital to develop
                            a mobile application to allow anesthesiology residents
                            log and evaluate the medical interventions they perform.
                            QAlog was developed for iOS and Android in C# using Xamarin.
                            The primary goal of this application is to provide
                            residents with an effective and user-friendly way to
                            record the anesthetic and echocardiographic operations
                            they've completed as part of their residency.

                            Worked in a 6-person agile team as a part of a Software
                            Development course taught in C++. We designed and programmed
                            an online housing service which connects students looking
                            for temporary housing with students who have available
                            rooms. The application used NodeJS and the REST API to
                            connect clients to a web server which used C++ objects
                            wrapped using Google's v8 Javascript engine library.
